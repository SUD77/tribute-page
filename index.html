      <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Mahamtma Gandhiji's life:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1869</strong> - Born in Porbandar, Western India.</li>
        <li><strong>1882</strong> - Gandhi, only 13 years old, marries Kasturba Kapadia, who is also 13. Kasturba will later participate in a number of her husband’s civil disobedience campaigns.</li>
        <li><strong>1888</strong> - Gandhi studies law in London. </li>
        <li><strong>1893</strong> - In 1893 Gandhi takes a job with an Indian law firm in South Africa, where he is quickly exposed to the racial discrimination practiced there.In 1894 he founds the Natal Indian Congress to agitate for Indian rights. Through that political organization he infuses a spirit of solidarity in the heterogeneous Indian community. He floods the government, the legislature, and the press with closely reasoned statements of Indian grievances.</li>
        <li><strong>1906</strong> - In 1906 a discriminatory law is passed in the Transvaal region of South Africa forcing all Indians to register with the provincial government or else face punishment. Under Gandhi’s leadership the Indian community takes a pledge to defy the law and to suffer all the penalties resulting from its defiance. This practice becomes known as satyagraha, a technique for redressing wrongs through inviting, rather than inflicting, suffering, for resisting adversaries without rancor, and fighting them without violence. </li>
        <li><strong>1915</strong> - Gandhi returns to India in 1915. </li>
        <li><strong>1919</strong> - In 1919 Gandhi becomes a leader in the Indian National Congress political party. He campaigns for swaraj, or “self-rule.” </li>
        <li><strong>1930</strong> - Gandhi leads tens of thousands of Indians on a 240-mile (385-kilometer) march to the sea to collect their own salt. The march is a protest against a British tax on salt and results in 60,000 people being arrested. In 1931 the British viceroy and Gandhi sign an agreement (the Gandhi-Irwin Pact) marking the end of a period of civil disobedience in India against British rule.</li>
        <li><strong>1942</strong> - Gandhi, who in 1934 had resigned as leader and member of the Indian National Congress, becomes politically active again early in World War II, demanding immediate independence as India’s price for aiding Britain in the war. He is imprisoned again, from 1942 to 1944. </li>
        <li><strong>1947</strong> - India formally achieves independence from British rule. However, the partition of the subcontinent into India and Pakistan is a great disappointment to Gandhi, who has long worked for Hindu-Muslim unity. Rioting between Muslims and Hindus over the partition breaks out in many areas. Again Gandhi turns to nonviolence, fasting until Delhi rioters pledge peace. </li>
        <li><strong>1948</strong> - While on his way to prayer in Delhi, Gandhi is killed by a young Hindu fanatic who has been angered by Gandhi’s efforts to reconcile Hindus and Muslims.  </li>
      </ul>
